            Hello! I'm Aishwarya Daga, a passionate Computer Science Engineering
            student at Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), who is passionate
            about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer
            Vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have worked as a Computer Vision Research Intern at IIT Madras,
            where I explored innovative approaches like Generalizable NeRF
            Transformers to enhance 3D scene rendering and manipulation.
            Throughout my career, I have gained valuable experience through
            internships at Pi Datacenters and Valsco Technology, where I
            developed AI-powered chatbots, worked on natural language processing
            (NLP), and contributed to web development projects. My work reflects
            my passion for solving real-world problems using advanced
            technologies.
          </p>

            <p>
              During my time as a Computer Vision Research Intern at IIT Madras
              under the Summer Fellowship Program, I focused on Generalizable
              NeRF Transformers (GNT), gaining hands-on experience with 3D scene
              rendering and manipulation. My primary task was to enhance GNT by
              incorporating depth information, aiming to improve the accuracy of
              3D renderings. This involved delving deep into the intricacies of
              3D scene reconstruction, applying advanced computer vision
              techniques to produce more precise and realistic visual outputs.
              The internship provided me with valuable exposure to cutting-edge
              research in 3D computer vision and further refined my technical
              and research skills.

            <p>
              During my time as an AI Intern at Pi Datacenters, I developed
              AI-powered chatbots using large language models (LLMs), LangChain,
              and Langflow, enhancing my skills in natural language processing
              and machine learning. I was involved in the creation of a website
              support agent that utilized Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for
              secure authentication and seamless user interaction. Additionally,
              I worked on integrating web scraping techniques and the Pinecone
              database to enable efficient search and storage capabilities. I
              also contributed to building customized chatbots for specific use
              cases, such as personal document handling, interview agents, and
              general query responses, employing ChromaDB and Dash to improve
              the interactivity and functionality of the bots.
