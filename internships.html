            Computer Vision Research Intern - IIT Madras
          </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              During my time as a Computer Vision Research Intern at IIT Madras
              under the Summer Fellowship Program, I focused on Generalizable
              NeRF Transformers (GNT), gaining hands-on experience with 3D scene
              rendering and manipulation. My primary task was to enhance GNT by
              incorporating depth information, aiming to improve the accuracy of
              3D renderings. This involved delving deep into the intricacies of
              3D scene reconstruction, applying advanced computer vision
              techniques to produce more precise and realistic visual outputs.
              The internship provided me with valuable exposure to cutting-edge
              research in 3D computer vision and further refined my technical
              and research skills.

            <p>
              During my time as an AI Intern at Pi Datacenters, I developed
              AI-powered chatbots using large language models (LLMs), LangChain,
              and Langflow, enhancing my skills in natural language processing
              and machine learning. I was involved in the creation of a website
              support agent that utilized Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for
              secure authentication and seamless user interaction. Additionally,
              I worked on integrating web scraping techniques and the Pinecone
              database to enable efficient search and storage capabilities. I
              also contributed to building customized chatbots for specific use
              cases, such as personal document handling, interview agents, and
              general query responses, employing ChromaDB and Dash to improve
              the interactivity and functionality of the bots.

          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              At Valsco Technology, I worked as a Frontend Web Development
              Intern, collaborating with the frontend team to design and develop
              the ‘About Us’ and ‘FAQ’ pages for the company’s website. I
              utilized React.js, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive,
              user-friendly layouts that were optimized for cross-browser and
              cross-device compatibility. My contributions helped improve the
              overall user experience and performance of the website. I also
              assisted in ensuring that the site was accessible and functional
              on various platforms, further honing my frontend development
              skills and gaining insights into best practices for web design and
              optimization.
